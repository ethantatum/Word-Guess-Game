    ## Description
    
    A movie-based hangman-style game coded in vanilla JavaScript. Users have a limited number of letter guesses per word. The application also tracks wins and losses. Upon successfully guessing a word, an embedded video from YouTube pops up with a clip from the guessed movie.
